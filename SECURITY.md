# Security Policy

Due to the nature of our work, maintaining a secure platform must be a high priority. This security policy is the first step to working toward that goal.

The primary objective is to develop and operate the platform in compliance with [OWASP best practices](https://owasp.org), beginning with the [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten).

## Supported Versions

There are no releases at this time, but when there are we will list which are actively supported for security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Vulnerability reports can be submitted in our GitHub repository, under the Security tab. If the vulnerability report is accepted, a notification of the
vulnerability will be issued and regular updates will be provided using confidential channels until a fix is produced. If it is initially declined, we
may request additional information to identify and reproduce the reported failure.
